## General <= pending update
The focus this time was on making easier to transfer the TFT files.

As this project grows with features, it becomes more hungry of resources from all sides (ESPHome, your Home Assistant server and even the Nextion display) and with that the chances of something going wrong when updating increased.

So at this release we concentrated on cleaning up de code everywhere and shave some unnecessary elements, making the system easier to install and opening some space for future features. But you still can find a couple of nice new things not related to the cleaning.

&nbsp;
## Updating
Updates may come with changes on the blueprint inputs and we highly recommend you review your settings and make sure all fields have the correct selection. We did our best to support your legacy settings and avoid breaking your system, but please double check your settings if you see something not working as expected.

### Files that need to be reloaded:
1. nspanel_eu.tft,  nspanel_us.tft or nspanel_us_land.tft - v4.2
2. nspanel_esphome.yaml - v4.2
3. nspanel_blueprint.yaml - v4.2

####

### Instructions
 _You can find the update procedures following here:_
- [How To - All important thing you should know - Update](docs/howto.md#update-blueprint)

&nbsp;
## Breaking changes
1. The `background` parameter in the `esphome.xxxxx_set_component_color` service is now deprecated.
2. With the introduction of additional custom buttons, the layout of other buttons on the home page has been adjusted.
3. Wi-Fi power save mode has been reset to `NONE` as the default setting.<br>This was the standard up to v4.0. We switched it in v4.1 to accommodate Bluetooth components. However, since this feature isn't widely used, we're reverting to the original setting. For Bluetooth usage, you should manually set a different mode, such as `LIGHT`, as shown in the customization example below:
```yaml
##### My customization - Start #####
# Enable Bluetooth proxy
bluetooth_proxy:
# Set Wi-Fi power save mode to "LIGHT" as required for Bluetooth on ESP32
wifi:
  power_save_mode: LIGHT
##### My customization - End #####
```
4. The default baud rate for advanced mode has been reverted to 115200 bps to resolve issues that arise when rendering button pages.
5. ESPHome v2023.12.0 has been established as the minimum required version to ensure optimal performance and compatibility, particularly with the recent developments in the Nextion component.
6. The Alarm section in the blueprint settings has been removed. All configurations previously made in this section have been automatically transferred to custom button 07.
7. Documentation in German is no longer maintained. This change allows us to more efficiently update and maintain the remaining documentation.

## Overview of noteworthy changes
1. Standardized entity's icons
2. Additional custom buttons on Home page
3. Outdoor temperature selectable font size
4. Select icon size for button's pages
5. Support to Chinese (Taiwan) and prepared for other CJK languages
6. Upload baud rate selectable as substitution
7. Multiple Alarm Control Panels
8. Support to `remote`

&nbsp;
## Details of noteworthy changes

### 1. Standardized entity's icons
The engine for defining the icons to be shown and it's color was standardize between all the pages, so now you may see a more consistent User's Interface.

&nbsp;
### 2. Additional custom buttons on Home page
It's that simple, now you have 7 buttons where used to be 3. Well, where used to be 4, as the space previously used by the Alarm button is now a custom button. ðŸ˜‰

&nbsp;
### 3. Outdoor temperature selectable font size
Now you can select the font size of your outdoor temperature display:

> Important: Long text with bigger fonts may exceed the limit of space reserved for this with incomplete information shown.

&nbsp;
### 4. Select icon size for button's pages
You can also select the size of the icons on the buttos pages:

<<add blueprint screenshot>>
<<add page screenshot (US and EU)>>

&nbsp;
### 5. Support to Chinese (Taiwan) and prepared for other CJK languages
You will find 3 new TFT files on the repository for the CJK languages. These files are considerably bigger, as the fonts requires more memory, but it should work fine in your panel.
Currently only translations to Chinese (Taiwan) are available, but as soon we get the strings for other languages we will be happy to add to the blueprint selection.
<< Add screenshots of blueprint >>

&nbsp;
### 6. Upload baud rate selectable as substitution
You can select an alternative baud rate for your TFT uploads. This allows faster TFT uploads and also supports displays previously set with baud rates not supported by this project (currently 115200 bps and 921600 bps).

To enable an alternative upload TFT baud rate, add the desired value in your substitutions like this:

```yaml
  upload_tft_baud_rate: "921600"
```

If an invalid value is entered or this substitution is not present, the current baud rate will be used.

The system will always fall back to the standard baud rate (115200 bps) if other tentatives fails.

&nbsp;
### 7. Multiple Alarm Control Panels
Now alarm control panel entities can be assigned to chips and custom buttons in the Home page, but also to hardware buttons, any of the buttons pages or entities pages, similarly to other domains.

&nbsp;
### 8. Support to `remote`
Entities from the `remote` domain can now be assigned to buttons (hardware and buttons pages) and custom buttons (home and climate pages).

The service `remote.toggle` will be called when the button is pressed.
